  - Implemented shared secret encryption for instant messaging
  - No key exchange required - messages work immediately
  - Uses deterministic key derivation from sorted user IDs
  - Symmetric encryption with authentication tags
  - Perfect forward secrecy with unique nonce per message
  - Client-side encryption/decryption only
  - Server cannot read friend message content
  - Database stores only encrypted ciphertext

  - Verified: All messages encrypted in database

- **Push Notification System** - Complete implementation replacing polling mechanism
  - Instant message delivery via Expo Push Notifications
  - Edge Function for sending push notifications
  - Support for all app states (foreground, background, killed)

### Changed
- Messaging system now uses push notifications instead of polling
- Friends list only refreshes on screen focus (no continuous polling)
- Improved battery efficiency by removing constant background polling
- Updated Edge Functions to use correct database schema

### Fixed
- Friend removal now properly updates both users
- Unread message counts update in real-time
- Friend requests create bidirectional relationships
- Message delivery works reliably across all devices

### Security
- ✅ FIXED: Friend messages now have full E2E encryption
