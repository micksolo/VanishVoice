# Native Module Fix: Screenshot Prevention

## Problem
The Android development build is failing with error:
```
mess runtime not ready cannot find native module screenshotprevent.js engine hermes
```

## Root Cause
The screenshot prevention native module (`modules/screenshot-prevent`) is not included in the current development build. Expo development builds need to be rebuilt whenever new native modules are added.

## Immediate Fix Applied
✅ **App no longer crashes**: Updated the module to gracefully handle missing native functionality
✅ **Error handling**: Added proper try/catch blocks to prevent runtime crashes
✅ **Fallback behavior**: App works without screenshot prevention until rebuild

## To Restore Full Functionality

### 1. Rebuild Development Build
The native module requires a new development build:

```bash
# For Android
npm run build:dev:android

# For iOS  
npm run build:dev:ios
```

### 2. Install New Development Build
Once the build completes:
- Download and install the new development build APK/IPA
- The screenshot prevention will work in the new build

### 3. Verify Fix
After installing the new build, check console logs for:
```
[NATIVE MODULE CHECK] ✅ Expo module loaded successfully
```

## Current Status
- ✅ App runs without crashing
- ✅ All other features work normally
- ⚠️ Screenshot prevention returns `false` (not available) until rebuild
- ⚠️ Premium security features show as unavailable

## Technical Details
- Updated `ScreenshotPreventModule.native.ts` with dynamic loading
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing native modules
- Module compilation fixed (TypeScript → JavaScript)
- Package configuration updated for Expo autolinking

## Next Steps
1. Rebuild the development build to include the native module
2. Test screenshot prevention on Android devices
3. Verify premium security features work as expected

This is a one-time rebuild required after adding the native module.
