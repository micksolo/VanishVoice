# Key Sync Fix Applied ‚úÖ

## The Problem
Both devices had NaCl keys generated locally but these keys were never synced to the database. This caused the "Recipient does not have encryption keys" error because:

1. Device 1 generated NaCl keys locally ‚úÖ
2. Device 1 stored them in AsyncStorage ‚úÖ
3. Device 1 NEVER uploaded the public key to database ‚ùå
4. Device 2 tries to send a message
5. Device 2 checks database for Device 1's public key
6. No public key found ‚Üí Error!

## The Root Cause
In `keyMigration.ts`, when the app found existing NaCl keys, it would return them immediately WITHOUT checking if they were synced to the database:

```javascript
// OLD CODE - BAD!
if (naclKeys) {
  console.log('User has NaCl keys');
  return { // Returns without syncing!
    publicKey: naclKeys.publicKey,
    privateKey: naclKeys.secretKey,
    secretKey: naclKeys.secretKey,
  };
}
```

## The Fix
I've updated the code to ALWAYS check and sync keys to the database:

```javascript
// NEW CODE - GOOD!
if (naclKeys) {
  console.log('User has NaCl keys');
  
  // Check if keys are in database
  const { data: userData } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('public_key, encryption_version')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .single();
  
  // Sync if missing or different
  if (!userData?.public_key || userData.public_key !== naclKeys.publicKey) {
    console.log('Syncing NaCl public key to database...');
    // Update database with public key
  }
  
  return naclKeys;
}
```

## What Happens Now

When you rebuild and run the app:

1. **App Launch**: "User has NaCl keys" (existing log)
2. **New Log**: "Syncing NaCl public key to database..."
3. **New Log**: "NaCl public key synced to database successfully"
4. **Result**: Both devices can send messages to each other!

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild the app** with this fix:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

2. **On both devices**:
   - Force close the app
   - Reopen it
   - Watch for the new sync logs

3. **Test messaging**:
   - Device 1 ‚Üí Device 2 ‚úÖ
   - Device 2 ‚Üí Device 1 ‚úÖ

## Additional Improvements

The fix also handles:
- Old secure storage keys (v2)
- Legacy storage keys (v1)
- Ensures ALL key types are synced to database
- Sets proper encryption_version for each type

## Verification

After reopening the app, check your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
SELECT id, username, friend_code, 
       public_key IS NOT NULL as has_key,
       encryption_version,
       key_generated_at
FROM users
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

Both users should now have:
- `has_key = true`
- `encryption_version = 3` (for NaCl)
- Recent `key_generated_at` timestamp

Your messaging should work perfectly now! üéâ
