# Security UX Design System

A comprehensive security notification system designed to convert free users to premium while building trust through transparency.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Security as a Feature** - Make users feel protected and informed
2. **Platform-Aware** - Different capabilities on iOS vs Android
3. **Conversion-Optimized** - Turn security concerns into premium upgrades
4. **Cyberpunk Aesthetic** - Match VanishVoice's dark, neon brand
5. **Non-Intrusive** - Inform without interrupting conversation flow

### User Psychology

- **Fear of Screenshot** → **Premium Conversion**
- **Security Events** → **Trust Building** 
- **Analytics Dashboard** → **Engagement & Value**
- **Platform Differences** → **Feature Differentiation**

## Visual Design System
