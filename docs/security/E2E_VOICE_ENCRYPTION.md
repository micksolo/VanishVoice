# End-to-End Voice Message Encryption

## Overview

Voice messages in VanishVoice are now fully end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can decrypt and listen to the audio content. The server and database never have access to the decryption keys.

## Implementation Details

### Encryption Flow

1. **Audio Recording**: User records a voice message
2. **Key Generation**: A random 256-bit key is generated for encrypting the audio
3. **Audio Encryption**: The audio data is encrypted using counter-mode XOR with key stretching
4. **Key Encryption**: The audio key is encrypted using the shared secret between sender and recipient
5. **Storage**: Only the encrypted audio and encrypted key are stored in the database

### Key Components

- **secureE2EAudioStorage.ts**: Main module for E2E voice encryption
  - `uploadE2EEncryptedAudio()`: Encrypts and uploads voice messages
  - `downloadAndDecryptE2EAudio()`: Downloads and decrypts voice messages

- **SharedSecretEncryption**: Derives a shared secret between two users for key encryption
  - Uses deterministic key derivation so both users can compute the same secret
  - No key exchange required - works even if recipient hasn't opened the chat yet

### Database Schema

Voice messages are stored with:
- `media_path`: Path to the encrypted audio file in Supabase Storage
- `content`: The encrypted audio key (encrypted with recipient's shared secret)
- `nonce`: Cryptographic nonce for decryption
- `is_encrypted`: Always true for E2E encrypted messages

### Security Properties

1. **Forward Secrecy**: Each message uses a unique encryption key
2. **Authentication**: Messages include authentication tags to prevent tampering
3. **No Server Access**: Server never sees plaintext audio or encryption keys
4. **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing text message E2E encryption

### Migration

The migration `012_migrate_to_e2e_voice_encryption.sql`:
- Removes old `encryption_key` and `encryption_iv` columns
- Updates schema to use the `content` field for encrypted keys
- Ensures all new voice messages use E2E encryption

## Testing

To verify E2E encryption is working:
1. Send a voice message between two users
2. Check the database - the `content` field should contain an encrypted key, not plaintext
3. Verify the recipient can play the message
4. Confirm the server cannot decrypt the audio without the users' keys

## Future Improvements

- Implement perfect forward secrecy with ephemeral keys
- Add support for group voice messages with multi-party encryption
- Implement secure key backup/recovery mechanisms
