# Development Build Status

## âœ… Successfully Created Development Build

You now have a development build running on the iOS simulator! This is different from Expo Go and includes:

- **Push notification support** (though simulator can't receive real push notifications)
- **Native modules** properly linked
- **expo-dev-client** for development features

## Fixed Issues

### 1. EAS Project Setup
- Created project ID: `40517f57-f67f-46ae-b512-923fd48d239a`
- Configured eas.json with proper settings

### 2. Encryption Key Generation Error
- **Issue**: `generateKeyPair is not a function`
- **Cause**: Function was named `generateUserKeyPair` but imported as `generateKeyPair`
- **Fix**: Updated the export in `encryption.ts` to use correct name alias

## Next Steps

### 1. Test on Physical Device
To test push notifications, you need to run on a real device:
```bash
# Connect your iPhone via USB
npx expo run:ios --device
```

### 2. Build for Android
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

### 3. Features to Test
- âœ… Voice recording and playback
- âœ… E2E encryption
- âœ… Friend management
- âœ… Username editing
- ðŸ”„ Push notifications (requires physical device)

## Important Notes

1. **Push Notifications**: Won't work on simulator but will work on physical devices
2. **Development vs Production**: This is a development build with debugging enabled
3. **Metro Server**: Keep the Metro bundler running for hot reloading

## Troubleshooting

If you see any errors after the encryption fix:
1. Reload the app (Cmd+R in simulator)
2. Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start --clear`
3. Clean build: `cd ios && rm -rf Pods && pod install`

The app should now work properly with all features except push notifications on the simulator.
