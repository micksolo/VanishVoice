# WYD - Anonymous Chat App Sprint Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
**WYD** (What You Doing) is an anonymous chat app for young adults that connects strangers for ephemeral conversations through text, voice, and video messages. Think "Omegle meets Snapchat" with a fun, casual vibe.

## Core Concept
- Anonymous stranger chat with optional friend connections
- All messages are ephemeral (disappear after viewing)
- Simple E2E encryption for privacy
- Fun, young adult-focused branding
- Mobile-only (iOS and Android) - no web version

## Sprint Development Philosophy
**Iterative Delivery**: Ship valuable features every 1-2 weeks with continuous user feedback. Focus on time-boxed iterations that deliver complete, testable functionality.

## Sprint Structure
- **Sprint Length**: 1 week (7 days)
- **Sprint Ceremonies**: Planning (Mon), Daily Standups, Review (Fri), Retrospective (Fri)
- **Definition of Done**: Feature tested on both iOS/Android, documented, merged to main
- **Velocity Tracking**: Story points and completion rates tracked per sprint

## ⚠️ SHELVED SPRINT: Sprint N+2 (August 9, 2025) - SCREENSHOT PREVENTION SHELVED
### Sprint Goal: "Screenshot Prevention & Security" - FEATURE SHELVED FOR MVP

**Story Points Completed**: 0 of 13 points (SHELVED - Feature removed from app)
**FEATURE STATUS**: 🚧 SHELVED - Screenshot prevention removed to unblock MVP progress
**Sprint Theme**: Feature shelved due to native module complexity blocking MVP launch
**Sprint Outcome**: Feature temporarily removed from app, code preserved for future implementation

### Why Feature Was Shelved:

#### TECHNICAL CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED:
- [ ] **Native Module Complexity** (High Complexity) 🚧 SHELVED
  - Android FLAG_SECURE implementation requires complex native module architecture
  - Expo config plugins causing development build issues
  - Cross-platform API consistency difficult to maintain
  - Native module debugging challenging in Expo environment

- [ ] **Development Build Dependencies** (Medium Complexity) 🚧 SHELVED
  - Screenshot prevention requires development builds (not Expo Go)
  - Native module changes require full rebuild cycles
  - Testing complexity increases significantly with native code
  - App store submission complexity with native modules

- [ ] **MVP Launch Priority** (Business Decision) 🚧 SHELVED
  - Feature adds significant complexity without core user value
  - MVP needs to launch quickly without advanced security features
  - Core messaging functionality more important than screenshot prevention
  - Can be implemented post-launch as premium feature

#### PRESERVED CODE ASSETS:
- [x] **Complete Implementation Available** 📦 PRESERVED
  - All security components coded and functional (/modules/screenshot-prevent/)
  - SecurityContext, useScreenshotSecurity hook implemented
  - UI components (SecurityShield, SecurityTrustScore, etc.) ready
  - Database schema and real-time notification system complete
  - Native module architecture documented and buildable

### Decision Outcome:
**Current Status**: All screenshot prevention code has been disabled but preserved
**Future Implementation**: Code can be re-enabled when native module issues are resolved
**Business Impact**: MVP can launch faster without complex security feature blocking progress

## Design Guidelines

### Brand Identity
- **Core**: Fun, casual, young adult focused (18-25)
- **Personality**: Spontaneous, mysterious, playful
- **Tone**: Casual, friendly, never serious

### Visual Design - "Neon Nights" Theme (Recommended)
- **Primary Colors**: 
  - Electric Purple (#B026FF) - Main accent
  - Neon Pink (#FF1B8D) - Highlights
  - Cyber Blue (#00D9FF) - Secondary
  - Laser Green (#00FF88) - Success states
- **Dark Theme**: Rich black (#0A0A0F) with neon accents
- **Effects**: Glowing elements, gradient message bubbles, neon trails

### Interactions & Animations
- **Messages**: Spring physics, pop-in effects, dissolve on expiry
- **Recording**: Colorful waveforms, pulsing buttons, progress rings
- **Reactions**: Double-tap hearts, emoji explosions, haptic feedback
- **Transitions**: Smooth 60fps, elastic scrolling, ripple effects
- **Sound**: Subtle UI sounds for send/receive/reactions

### Key Differentiators from Snapchat
- More anonymous/mysterious aesthetic
- Neon cyberpunk vibes vs bright yellow
- Focus on ephemeral connections, not social network
- Glowing UI elements emphasizing temporary nature

## Success Metrics
- Daily active users
- Average session length
- Messages per conversation
- Premium conversion rate
- Report rate (lower is better)
- User retention (1-day, 7-day)

## Future Features (Post-Launch)
- **Screenshot Prevention & Security** (SHELVED - Re-implement Post-Launch)
  - Complete screenshot prevention system with Android FLAG_SECURE
  - iOS screenshot detection with notifications
  - Premium security features and monetization
  - Trust scoring and security analytics
  - All code preserved in /modules/screenshot-prevent/ and security components
  - Native module challenges need resolution before re-implementation
- **Performance: Native Crypto Optimization** (High Priority)
  - Video decryption currently 10-15s (nacl.secretbox limitation)
  - Implement native crypto libraries or streaming decryption
  - Target: <3s total download time for videos
- Interest/topic matching
- Voice filters (fun effects)
- Group chat rooms
- React to messages
- Enhanced privacy features (blur on background, watermarks)
- Verified badges for content creators
- AR filters for video messages

## Key Decisions
- Simple E2E encryption (not Signal-level)
- No message history by default
- Device-based identity (not accounts)
- Gender + location as primary paid features
- Focus on 18-25 age demographic
- English-first, expand languages later

## Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/micksolo/WYD
- Will need new app store listings
- New privacy policy for anonymous chat
- Updated terms of service

## Tagline Ideas (Security-Focused)
- "WYD? Chat anonymously. Actually anonymously."
- "Anonymous chat that even we can't read"
- "WYD? Find out. Securely."
- "Real privacy. Real conversations. WYD?"
- "Chat like Snap. Secure like Signal. WYD?"
- "Your chats. Your keys. WYD?"
- "E2E encrypted. Actually ephemeral. WYD?"
- "They can't read it. We can't read it. WYD?"

## Key Differentiator
Unlike Snapchat and other "anonymous" apps, WYD features:
- True end-to-end encryption (messages are encrypted on your device)
- No server-side message access (we literally cannot read your messages)
- Ephemeral by design (messages truly disappear)
- No data mining or ad targeting (because we can't see your content)
