# WYD - Anonymous Chat App Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
**WYD** (What You Doing) is an anonymous chat app for young adults that connects strangers for ephemeral conversations through text, voice, and video messages. Think "Omegle meets Snapchat" with a fun, casual vibe.

## Core Concept
- Anonymous stranger chat with optional friend connections
- All messages are ephemeral (disappear after viewing)
- Simple E2E encryption for privacy
- Fun, young adult-focused branding
- Mobile-only (iOS and Android) - no web version

## Development Philosophy
**Core Features First**: Complete the essential user experience before adding account management. Users can't miss features they haven't experienced yet, but they will immediately notice missing core functionality.

## Phase 1: MVP - Anonymous Chat ‚úÖ COMPLETED
*All features documented in CHANGELOG.md*

## Phase 2: Core Features Completion (1-2 weeks)

### ‚úÖ SECURITY STATUS UPDATE
**Text Messages**: ‚úÖ E2E encrypted via SharedSecretEncryption
**Voice Messages**: ‚úÖ E2E encrypted via secureE2EAudioStorage
**Video Messages**: ‚úÖ E2E encrypted via secureE2EVideoStorageFastAndroid
**Anonymous Chat**: ‚úÖ E2E encrypted via NaCl

All message types now have proper E2E encryption:
- Text: Shared secret encryption with authentication
- Voice: Unique key per message, encrypted with recipient's key
- Video: XOR encryption with unique keys, encrypted with shared secret
- Anonymous: NaCl box encryption with ephemeral keys
- Server cannot decrypt any message content, audio, or video


### Account Recovery System (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Why Important**: Users losing accounts = bad retention
**When to Implement**: After core features are complete and polished

- [ ] **Username + Password Recovery**
  - [ ] Add password_hash field to users table (nullable)
  - [ ] "Set Password" UI in Profile screen (optional but encouraged)
  - [ ] Password validation (min 8 chars, strong password rules)
  - [ ] Secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
  - [ ] Remove old recovery code system (recoveryCode.ts)
  
- [ ] **Account Recovery Flow**
  - [ ] "Sign In" option on auth screen
  - [ ] Username + password login form
  - [ ] Recover: identity, friends list, settings, premium status
  - [ ] Generate new encryption keys on new device
  - [ ] Clear messaging: "Messages are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be recovered"
  - [ ] Store new device keys in key_storage table

- [ ] **Default Username System** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Auto-generate fun usernames (CoolPanda123)
  - [x] Ensure uniqueness on creation
  - [ ] Show username prominently in UI (home screen welcome)
  - [ ] Encourage password setup in onboarding flow

- [ ] **Security Considerations**
  - [ ] Hybrid approach: password recovers identity, not messages
  - [ ] Each device gets unique encryption keys
  - [ ] Friends can re-establish secure connections
  - [ ] Optional: backup encryption keys to cloud (future feature)

### Friend System Enhancements  
- [ ] Enhanced friend features
  - [ ] Optional profile photo upload
  - [ ] Phone number hashing for discovery
  - [ ] QR code/link sharing
  - [ ] Online/offline status

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo) - iOS & Android only
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Realtime)
- **Encryption**: NaCl (TweetNaCl) - Both anonymous and friend chat ‚úÖ
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Push Service ‚úÖ (Implemented)
- **Payments**: Native IAP only (no Stripe needed) - Pending
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel/Amplitude - Pending

## Design Guidelines

### Brand Identity
- **Core**: Fun, casual, young adult focused (18-25)
- **Personality**: Spontaneous, mysterious, playful
- **Tone**: Casual, friendly, never serious

### Visual Design - "Neon Nights" Theme (Recommended)
- **Primary Colors**: 
  - Electric Purple (#B026FF) - Main accent
  - Neon Pink (#FF1B8D) - Highlights
  - Cyber Blue (#00D9FF) - Secondary
  - Laser Green (#00FF88) - Success states
- **Dark Theme**: Rich black (#0A0A0F) with neon accents
- **Effects**: Glowing elements, gradient message bubbles, neon trails

### Interactions & Animations
- **Messages**: Spring physics, pop-in effects, dissolve on expiry
- **Recording**: Colorful waveforms, pulsing buttons, progress rings
- **Reactions**: Double-tap hearts, emoji explosions, haptic feedback
- **Transitions**: Smooth 60fps, elastic scrolling, ripple effects
- **Sound**: Subtle UI sounds for send/receive/reactions

### Key Differentiators from Snapchat
- More anonymous/mysterious aesthetic
- Neon cyberpunk vibes vs bright yellow
- Focus on ephemeral connections, not social network
- Glowing UI elements emphasizing temporary nature

## Success Metrics
- Daily active users
- Average session length
- Messages per conversation
- Premium conversion rate
- Report rate (lower is better)
- User retention (1-day, 7-day)

## Future Features (Post-Launch)
- **Performance: Native Crypto Optimization** (High Priority)
  - Video decryption currently 10-15s (nacl.secretbox limitation)
  - Implement native crypto libraries or streaming decryption
  - Target: <3s total download time for videos
- Interest/topic matching
- Voice filters (fun effects)
- Group chat rooms
- React to messages
- Enhanced privacy features (blur on background, watermarks)
- Verified badges for content creators
- AR filters for video messages

## Key Decisions
- Simple E2E encryption (not Signal-level)
- No message history by default
- Device-based identity (not accounts)
- Gender + location as primary paid features
- Focus on 18-25 age demographic
- English-first, expand languages later

## Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/micksolo/WYD
- Will need new app store listings
- New privacy policy for anonymous chat
- Updated terms of service

## Tagline Ideas (Security-Focused)
- "WYD? Chat anonymously. Actually anonymously."
- "Anonymous chat that even we can't read"
- "WYD? Find out. Securely."
- "Real privacy. Real conversations. WYD?"
- "Chat like Snap. Secure like Signal. WYD?"
- "Your chats. Your keys. WYD?"
- "E2E encrypted. Actually ephemeral. WYD?"
- "They can't read it. We can't read it. WYD?"

## Key Differentiator
Unlike Snapchat and other "anonymous" apps, WYD features:
- True end-to-end encryption (messages are encrypted on your device)
- No server-side message access (we literally cannot read your messages)
- Ephemeral by design (messages truly disappear)
- No data mining or ad targeting (because we can't see your content)
