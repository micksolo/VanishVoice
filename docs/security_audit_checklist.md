# VanishVoice Security Audit Checklist

## Pre-Production Security Audit

### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**
- [ ] Verify anonymous user creation is secure
- [ ] Test RLS policies on all tables
- [ ] Ensure users can only access their own data
- [ ] Verify friend connections are bidirectional where needed
- [ ] Test that expired messages are inaccessible

### 2. **Data Encryption**
- [ ] Implement client-side encryption for voice messages
- [ ] Verify encryption keys are never sent to server
- [ ] Ensure proper key management and storage
- [ ] Test that server cannot decrypt voice messages
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced for all API calls

### 3. **Input Validation**
- [ ] Sanitize friend codes before database insertion
- [ ] Validate audio file formats and sizes
- [ ] Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validate all user inputs (nicknames, etc.)
- [ ] Test file upload size limits (10MB)

### 4. **API Security**
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] CORS configuration review
- [ ] API key rotation strategy
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in API responses
- [ ] Test for timing attacks on friend code lookups

### 5. **Storage Security**
- [ ] Verify voice messages bucket is not publicly accessible
- [ ] Test storage access policies
- [ ] Ensure proper file naming (no user data in filenames)
- [ ] Verify expired files are permanently deleted
- [ ] Check for path traversal vulnerabilities

### 6. **Privacy & Data Protection**
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Verify message expiry works correctly
- [ ] Test that deleted data is unrecoverable
- [ ] Ensure no PII in logs or analytics
- [ ] Implement user data export functionality

### 7. **Client-Side Security**
- [ ] Secure storage of user credentials
- [ ] Certificate pinning for API calls
- [ ] Obfuscate sensitive business logic
- [ ] Disable debugging in production builds
- [ ] Implement jailbreak/root detection

### 8. **Third-Party Dependencies**
- [ ] Audit all npm packages for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review Supabase security settings
- [ ] Check for known CVEs in dependencies
- [ ] Implement dependency update strategy
- [ ] Review permissions requested by app

### 9. **Infrastructure Security**
- [ ] Enable Supabase security features
- [ ] Configure proper backup strategy
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement DDoS protection
- [ ] Review Edge Function permissions

### 10. **Testing Strategy**
- [ ] Penetration testing by security firm
- [ ] Automated security scanning (SAST/DAST)
- [ ] Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- [ ] Load testing for DoS prevention
- [ ] Security regression testing

## Security Testing Tools

### Recommended Tools:
1. **OWASP ZAP** - For API security testing
2. **Burp Suite** - For penetration testing
3. **npm audit** - For dependency vulnerabilities
4. **MobSF** - For mobile app security testing
5. **Snyk** - For continuous security monitoring

### Manual Testing:
1. Try to access other users' messages
2. Attempt to bypass expiry rules
3. Test friend code enumeration
4. Verify voice messages are truly deleted
5. Check for information disclosure
