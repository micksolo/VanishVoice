# Buffer Error Fix Applied ‚úÖ

## The Problem
The NaCl implementation was using Node.js's `Buffer` which doesn't exist in React Native by default, causing:
```
ERROR [NaClKeyStorage] Error storing keys: [ReferenceError: Property 'Buffer' doesn't exist]
```

## The Solution
I've added the necessary imports and global polyfill:

1. **Added Buffer import** to `/src/utils/nacl/naclKeyStorage.ts`:
   ```javascript
   import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
   ```

2. **Added global Buffer polyfill** to `index.ts`:
   ```javascript
   import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
   global.Buffer = Buffer;
   ```

## Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild Your App
Since we modified `index.ts`, you need to restart Metro and rebuild:

```bash
# Kill any running Metro bundler
# Then rebuild:
npx expo run:ios --device

# Or if using EAS:
eas build --platform ios --profile development --clear-cache
```

### 2. Clear App Data (Important!)
On your device:
1. Delete the VanishVoice app
2. Reinstall from the new build
3. This ensures clean key generation

### 3. Verify It's Working
After reinstalling, check the logs. You should see:
- ‚úÖ `[NaClKeyStorage] New NaCl keys generated and stored`
- ‚úÖ `[NaClMigration] Migration completed successfully`
- ‚ùå No more Buffer errors

## Why This Happened
- React Native doesn't include Node.js APIs like `Buffer`
- The `buffer` package provides a polyfill
- We need to explicitly import and set it globally

## Additional Notes
- The `buffer` package was already in your dependencies
- We just needed to wire it up properly
- This is a common React Native gotcha

Your app should now work properly with NaCl encryption! üîê
