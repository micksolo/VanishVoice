## In Progress ðŸ”„
- [ ] Client-side encryption for voice messages (90% complete)
- [ ] Security audit preparation

## Pending Features ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Push notifications for new messages

## Key Decisions Made
- Using anonymous users for MVP (no email/phone required)
- 60-second max recording duration
- Friend connections via shareable codes
- Messages vanish immediately after playback
- Privacy-first design (sender hidden until revealed)
- React Native + Expo for cross-platform development
- Supabase for backend (database, storage, auth)
- Unidirectional friendships (like Twitter follow model)
- Usernames optional but encouraged for better UX
- Friend code shown only when username not set

## Security Considerations
- Created comprehensive security audit checklist
- Client-side encryption implemented (using expo-crypto)
  - Voice messages encrypted before upload
  - Encryption keys generated per user
  - Decryption on playback
  - Need to improve key exchange mechanism
- RLS policies in place for data access control
- Storage bucket configured with proper access controls
- Planning professional security audit before launch

## Next Priority Tasks
1. **Security audit** - Complete checklist items
2. **Encryption** - Implement client-side voice encryption
3. **Push notifications** - Critical for user engagement
4. **Time-based expiry** - Messages expire even if unplayed
