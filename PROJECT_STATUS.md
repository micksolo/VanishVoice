## In Progress ðŸ”„
- [ ] Push notifications for new messages (80% complete)
  - Database table created âœ…
  - Push token registration implemented âœ…
  - Edge function created and deployed âœ…
  - Local notification testing added âœ…
  - **IMPORTANT**: Expo Go no longer supports push notifications in SDK 53+
  - Need to create a development build to test push notifications
  - See DEVELOPMENT_BUILD_SETUP.md for instructions

## Pending Features ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Save request feature with mutual consent
- [ ] Time-based expiry (expire even if not played)
- [ ] Blocked users management screen
- [ ] Location-based expiry
- [ ] Event-based expiry
- [ ] Onboarding tutorial
- [ ] Voice message waveform visualization

## Key Decisions Made
- Using anonymous users for MVP (no email/phone required)
- 60-second max recording duration
- Friend connections via shareable codes
- Messages vanish immediately after playback
- Privacy-first design (sender hidden until revealed)
- React Native + Expo for cross-platform development
- Supabase for backend (database, storage, auth)
- Unidirectional friendships (like Twitter follow model)
- Usernames optional but encouraged for better UX
- Friend code shown only when username not set

## Security Considerations
- Created comprehensive security audit checklist
- Client-side E2E encryption implemented âœ…
  - Voice messages encrypted before upload
  - Public/private key pairs generated per user
  - Proper E2E encryption with recipient's public key
  - Fixed encoding issues with binary data handling
  - Encryption keys stored locally in AsyncStorage
- RLS policies in place for data access control
- Storage bucket configured with proper access controls
- Planning professional security audit before launch

## Next Priority Tasks
1. **Push notifications testing** - Test on physical devices
2. **Security audit** - Complete checklist items
3. **Time-based expiry** - Messages expire even if unplayed
4. **Save request feature** - Allow mutual consent saving
